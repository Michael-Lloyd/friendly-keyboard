# friendly-keyboard

This project stems from a (much delayed) collaborative project with a friend from work. It's a bluetooth enabled keyboard, that functions similarly to the logitech MX keys, but with much more, and less problems. The end goal is to provide him the design, but between those steps I've found ways to make improvements over common design choices.
